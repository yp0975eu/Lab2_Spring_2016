/**
 Problem 2, Delivery Company:

 A parcel delivery company charges the following rates to ship a parcel.

 Up to 5 pounds: $2.45 per pound
 Up to 10 pounds: $2.15 per pound
 Up to 15 pounds: $1.95 per pound
 Up to 20 pounds: $1.55 per pound
 Up to 30 pounds: $1.15 per pound

 The shipping company does not ship parcels that weigh over 30 pounds.

 So, a parcel that weighs 17 pounds will cost $1.55 x 17 = $26.35.

 Write a program thatÂ asks the user for the weight of a parcel and displays whether it can be shipped, and what it will cost.
